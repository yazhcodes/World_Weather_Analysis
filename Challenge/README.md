# World Weather Analysis
  This project is about building a **Weather Database** for around 1500 cities worldwide and using this resource to provide the following services to a client:
  * Narrowing down the list of vacation destinations based on _temperature preferences_
  * Planning _Vacation Itinerary_ 
  * Providing nearby _Hotel information_

Here's an example of a **Vacation Itinerary and Hotel Information for a trip to Mauritius**!
